# passphrase-machine

## Description


I built this password with the intention to create a random password generator so that a user could generate a complete, random password that specified their desired length, upper or lower case letters, numbers, and/or symbols. I learned a lot about javascript and using the If conditionals building my code. I also learnt how important it is to pseudocode to help you complete the problem correctly and within the appropriate guidlines. I further learnt more about functions and variables and how to use them properly. I also learnt how to use the window.prompt property.
